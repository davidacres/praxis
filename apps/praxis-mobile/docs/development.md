# Mobile development and future extraction

## Current state

This is a documentation and planning scaffold. There is no runnable mobile app, package manifest, installed framework or Azure deployment. FX-BE-080 selects and establishes the platform shell and renderer build. Do not add this folder to root build workspaces until runnable scripts exist.

## Conventions inherited from desktop

Feature ownership stays in feature folders. Main owns native/platform adapters; renderer owns UI. Reuse token-based themes, icons, in-app dialogs and visible focus. Core's CommonJS Node dependencies cannot be imported as runtime values into the renderer. Contract/UI reuse requires a browser-safe versioned boundary. No desktop-source relative imports in mobile runtime code.

Plans use docs/plans/features/fx-bf-NNN-slug/feature.md, stories/fx-be-NNN-slug/story.md and tasks/task-NNN-slug.md. Every item has explicit type, unique id, H1, status, Dependencies, acceptance and verification. Keep frontmatter and prose dependencies aligned. Issues are mirrors outside the parsed plans tree. IDs 028–033 / 074–085 / 201–236 are allocated from the existing repository sequence, not reset for this project.

## Plan validation

Run the repository's read-only parsePlanFolder over the unchanged root plan tree and this mobile plan tree. Expect mobile: 6 features, 12 Story children and 36 Task children, with stable explicit IDs and no 9000+ fallback allocation. Compare root counts before/after, validate links and dependency graph, and ensure parent metadata resolves. Do not invoke FolderService against source plans because it can write template upgrades. Use temporary copies for any application journey.

## Implementation verification

Use scripted host/agent/identity/relay fixtures by default; paid agents and real Azure are explicit opt-ins. Run focused contract, desktop parity and mobile integration checks. UI changes need fresh inspected captures and accessibility checks. Physical iOS/Android journeys are required for platform-dependent discovery, pairing, backgrounding and internet milestones; screenshots alone do not prove these capabilities.

## Repository extraction

Move this folder intact when authorised: README, main, renderer, docs, board.praxis.json and project.praxis.md. Keep plan IDs stable and internal links relative. Consume published/pinned protocol and UI assets rather than root filesystem paths. Host/API/service implementation stays with its owner; record source repos and contract versions. Add independent mobile version/release/CI configuration during implementation. Prove a temporary standalone build in TASK-235; this plan does not perform the move.
